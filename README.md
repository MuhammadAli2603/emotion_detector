Emotion Detection using AI - PyPower Project
This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial emotion detection. Using deep learning, the model classifies facial expressions into different emotion categories.

Project Overview
The Emotion Detection system leverages a pretrained model based on the MobileNet architecture and Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. The goal is to classify facial emotions in real-time from webcam feed or image input.

Key Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection: The system detects emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral directly from video feed.

Pretrained Models: The system uses a pre-trained model (emotion_model.h5) for classification, trained on facial expression datasets.

Face Detection: A Haar Cascade Classifier is used to detect faces in real-time, providing the region of interest for emotion classification.

Multiple Emotion Categories: The system can identify seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary libraries via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the Dataset
You can find the Kaggle dataset used for training at the following link:

Kaggle Dataset: Challenges in Representation Learning - Facial Expression Recognition Challenge

Place the dataset in the appropriate directories as described below.

4. Training the Model
Use the train.py file to train the emotion detection model. Modify the number of classes or experiment with different pre-trained models as needed.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
The trained model will be saved as emotion_model.h5 after successful training.

5. Testing the Model
After training, use the test.py file to test the emotion detection model.

bash
Copy
Edit
python test.py
This script will start a webcam feed and begin detecting faces and their corresponding emotions. Press q to exit the feed.

6. Modifying Face Detection Classifier
If you want to use a different face detector, replace the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file with a custom one and update the path in the test.py script.

File Details
1. train.py
Purpose: Script to train the emotion detection model using the MobileNet architecture.

Libraries Used: Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV

Model Used: MobileNet with custom fully connected layers on top.

2. test.py
Purpose: Script to run emotion detection in real-time using a webcam.

Libraries Used: OpenCV, Keras

Class Labels: The model detects seven emotion categories:

Angry

Disgust
